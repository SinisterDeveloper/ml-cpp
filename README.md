implement and use ML algorithms in C++ to try and understand them on a deeper level rather than blindly using libraries which abstract the internal mechanisms

will do this publicly to be accountable and a bit more serious

the implementations will probaly (most likely) not be the most optimised - so beware before using this as a source for implementations

follow the journey!!
